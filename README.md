Elderly Care Systems:
Old age is a sensitive phase - elderly people need care and comfort to lead a healthy life
without worries and anxiety. Lack of awareness regarding the changing behavioral patterns
in elderly people at home leads to abuse of them by their kin. Various issues affect the
lives of senior citizens and further complicate into major physiological and psychological
problems. Along with increased risk of diseases in old age, there are various other issues
that lead to the downfall of the health of the old people. The elderly population have various
complex needs (physical, emotional, nutritional, financial) and the inability of the younger
family members to understand these needs lead to them regarding the elderly individuals as
a burden. Elders suffering from cognitive challenges undergo serious personality changes;
at this point, they need care and attention.
  In this project we have developed an elderly care app for elders in case of emergencies. Our app consists
of one SOS button,one contacts button and one default text which is editable. SOS button helps them
during any kind of emergencies
